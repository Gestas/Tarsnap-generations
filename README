SYNOPSIS
	tarsnap-generations

	ARGUMENTS:
		 ?   Display this help.    
		-f   Path to a file with a list of folders to be backed up. List should be \n delimited.  
		-h   Number of hourly backups to retain.
		-d   Number of daily backups to retain.
		-w   Number of weekly backups to retain.
		-m   Number of monthly backups to retain.

DESCRIPTION

	The script is designed to be run via crontab. It expects five inputs and a .tarsnaprc file (see below). If you don't want to take hourly backups then use crontab to schedule backup only in the hour specified in the script as the $DAILY_TIME variable, line 9. Set -h to "1". By default the script takes the "DAILY" backup in the 23:00 hour system time. 

REQUIRES
	The script requires a .tarsnaprc that specifies at least these options;
		keyfile <path to keyfile>
		cachedir <path to cache dir>
		exclude <path to cache dir>
		humanize-numbers

CRONTAB EXAMPLES 
	
	15 * * * * tarsnap-generations.sh -f /root/tarsnap.folders -h 36 -d 30 -w 12 -m 24 << Takes a backup every hour at the :15, keeps 36 hours of hourly backup, 30 days of daily backups, 12 weeks of weekly backups and 2 years of monthly backups.   
	
	30 23 * * * tarsnap-generations.sh -f /root/tarsnap.folders -h 1 -d 10 -w 4 -m 2 << No hourly backups, daily backup at 23:30, keep 10 days of daily backups, 4 weeks of weekly backups and 2 months of monthly backups. Note that the hour here (23) must match the hour set by $DAILY_TIME, line 9 of the script. 23 (11PM) is the default.

ERRORS
	The script will exit with a non 0 error code if a backup fails or can't be verified. Be sure to pay attention.
